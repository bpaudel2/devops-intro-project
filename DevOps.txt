What is not DevOps?
- Is not about the tool
- Is not Developer or Operation alone

Software development:
- DevOps
- Agile
- Continous integration
- Monitoring

Agile and DevOps are different. Agile includes Plan, Code and Test but not deployment and operation.
Automating testing is continous integration. Continous delivery also includes release as well. So,
Agile Development + Continous Integration + Delivery + Operate
